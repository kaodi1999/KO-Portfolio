SQL Portfolio done entirely by Kaodi Okafor

HelloðŸ˜„! Thank you for stopping by. This portfolio contains SQL Projects from before and during my Master's Program, where I earned my degree in Data Science and Analytics. I have also included some solo projects from my time after graduation that I completed for fun! I am capable of working through complicated SQL codes, as well as machine learning, and other data analytics languages. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions. Email:(kaodiokafor@gmail.com)

# Beginner SQL Code #
- NFL Fantasy Football Project
  - In [this](https://github.com/kaodi1999/SQL-Portfolio-KO/blob/6986f8c20ead8644e0afd61976cb9145ae75d6e0/NFL%20Analysis) project, I used an NFL Fantasy Football dataset I found on Kaggle to find different answers to random questions. This was used as a practice study, so it may seem a bit basic; however, there is more to come!

# Netflix Project #
Here is a project using netflix data.
