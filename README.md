# Kaodi Okafor's SQL Portfolio
SQL Portfolio done entirely by Kaodi Okafor

Hello! Thank you for stopping by. This portfolio contains SQL Projects from before and during graduate school. I have also included some solo projects from my time after graduation. I am capable of working through SQL codes, as well as machine learning, and other data analytics languages. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.
